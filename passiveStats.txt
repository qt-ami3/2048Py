every combination there is a percent chance depending on the resulting combination (for example 2 + 2 combination is a 4%) that random tile will be picked (for example a 4 x 4 = a 1 in 14) and if that tile has a numbered value (not a power up) then you will be able to pick from a random passiv for that tile and tiles that get combined into it. if the combination exceeds 100% for a tile pick then it will roll another random tile (for example 64 + 64 is a 100% chance for 1 tile and a 28% chance for a second tile. use a similar menu to the Passives menu. and indicate passiv stats with a dot under the value and hovering over it with your mouse while not selecting an ability shows a menu with the passive effects.). exclude newly created tiles from calculation, make menu only show up if a occupied tile was selected.

for now just use this one passive

Passive abilites:

a little slow: if effected tile is not moving moving will set predetermined path as normal except it will only move once per player turn, only stopping if it reaches its original destination, runs into a wall, or runs into a tile. ignores player input until finished.
